      * The development of Torn's API v2 is still ongoing.  * If selections remain unaltered, they will default to the API v1 version.  * Unlike API v1, API v2 accepts both selections and IDs as path and query parameters.  * If any discrepancies or errors are found, please submit a [bug report](https://www.torn.com/forums.php#/p=forums&f=19&b=0&a=0) on the Torn Forums.  * In case you're using bots to check for changes on openapi.json file, make sure to specificy a custom user-agent header - CloudFlare sometimes prevents requests from default user-agents.
